First, here is a guide for you to start your custom domain names on your openshift application.

[https://www.openshift.com/blogs/custom-url-names-for-your-paas-applications-host-forwarding-and-cnames-the-openshift-way](https://www.openshift.com/blogs/custom-url-names-for-your-paas-applications-host-forwarding-and-cnames-the-openshift-way).

If you want your visitors be able to visit your custom domain through a.com instead of www.a.com. One way is toÂ point your www cname to blabla-username.rhcloud.com at your domain dns controller and forward your A record to **wwwizer.com** 's ip ( **174.129.25.170** ) it's done!

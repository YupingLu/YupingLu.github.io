2017, I'm still single with nobody by my side. I really can't remember how many valentine's days I have spent like this. I have dreamed thousands of time how my valentine will be. He is handsome, tall, cute and warm. I like his childish smile, brown hair and big eyes. I love him and he loves me back. That I could say words like you're the most beautiful view in my life to him.

However life is not like what you have expected it to be. I didn't get it just like my job hunting failaure. Sometimes I started to doubt the meaning of life. Why on earth I work so hard to get nothing in my life. No paper, no lover, no job. Nothing! I feel like a total failure, a joke.

I know God has a purpose for all of us. No one's path is the same. You have to walk on your way with courage and perseverance. But it's the feeling of loneiness which is killing me. I'm still waiting rather than searching for that person to my life. Where are you, my Valentine?

But at least you have your family and friends, right? I still believe that person will come to my life one day.

Below is a snapshot of my Chinese New Year visit this year.

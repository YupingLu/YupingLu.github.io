**Faith beyond all doubt**

If you have faith and do not doubt ... even if you say to this mountain,  "Be lifted up and thrown into the sea," it will be done.--Matthew 21:21

My dear brothers and sisters,

Let  us stand on this promise knowing that we have the strength of God in  us. When the winds of change are blowing and our future is unclear,  remember Jesus' words to his disciples: "If you have faith and do not  doubt ... it will be done."

All things are possible :)

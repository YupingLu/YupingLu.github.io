Dear friend, thanks for sharing your life with me this summer. It's a beautiful memory, I will remember it forever. It's you that let me know the real me.

I still remember our first met in Haw Ridge Park. You look so young, as my friend said, like a high school student. You are smart and kind. That's why I like to talk with you. I enjoy our talk.

This summer, we camped and hiked in the Smoky Mountain. We cooked together, I like your simple but delicious vege food... The places we have been to remind me of you. So, I just avoid them to affect my fragile nerve. Sorry, I am so emotional that I cried before the day you leave. I cried even more when I saw the letter you written to me. Dear friend, thanks for being with me. It's hard for me, I feel so sad. But don't worry about me, I will be fine.

Like you said, hope we have the chance to hike again. But I know I will see you again in the future.
